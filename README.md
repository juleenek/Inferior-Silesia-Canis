# Inferior Silesia Canis 

The website for [Inferior Silesia Canis](https://metaksa1.github.io/Project-Dogs/index.html) was made as a semester project for the subject [Introduction to web technologies](https://github.com/metaksa1/Technologie-webowe).

The project aimed to show the ability to use technologies such as HTML and CSS (and to a small extent also JavaScript).
